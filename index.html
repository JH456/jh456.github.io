          Hey, I'm a third year Computer Science student at the Georgia
          Institute of Technology. My threads are Systems/Architecture and
          Information/Internetworks. If you wanna see my whole shpiel for some
          reason, keep reading. If you want the tl;dr you can check out my
          resume`. I have links to some of my social media profiles, but I
          don't post on them really. Feel free to look me up on facebook or
          whatever. Google+ is mostly there to be ironic (also I don't feel like
          adding more links right now). If you want to keep up to date with
          my projects for some reason, I'd suggest following my GitHub. It's
          pretty lit.
          </p>

          I've got a few hobbies sort of. During my formative years I played a
          ton of WoW, and still pop back in there every once in a while because
          I still know some people who play. I don't game a ton these days, but
          am pretty into that whole fantasy genre. Swords are pretty neat. I
          actually have a few, but might try and get rid of a couple of them
          because I'm not super interested in <a href='https://i.redditmedia.com/zfCHErQ0coKUzQFlt89bRJopUrKya76YUXrUUvdxih4.jpg?w=827&s=e2be21a9f60842e3ae235ab879cf7705'>studying the blade</a>.
          I like watching cartoons, japanese and not. Kind of having an issue
          where I tend to live my life in increments of Rick and Morty seasons,
          which feels a little unhealthy. I also like to fold origami birds
          (and also dinosaurs sometimes), and try to keep some kami paper in
          my bag for when I get bored. Pretty good for adding some color to my
          workspaces, and they also make good bookmarks. Recently I started
          trying my hand at baking. I found this apple muffin recipe that's
          pretty sweet (heh). Of course I have some personal programming
          projects I like to work on to grow my skills. I don't have a ton
          of time to work during the school year, but you can check out some of
          the things I've worked on in the projects section. Recently I started
          keeping a backlog of ideas to work on, so hopefully I'll be able to
          add to that section a bit more soon. In particular, I like working on
          projects where I can check out a new programming language. The field
          is always moving forward in that vein, so I like being able to check
          out what's out there.

          I've worked for three semesters as a TA
          for CS1331, which is our Introduction to Object Oriented Programming
          class (which is taught in Java). So, I know Java and OOP concepts
          pretty good. The job involves teaching recitation to ~50 students with
          another TA, writing homework assignments, grading, and holding office
          hours. I really enjoy teaching, and may consider a career as an
          educator, but I'm still kind of working out where I want to be going.
          In the coming Fall, I'll actually work for CS2110, which is our
          Computer Organization and Programming course at Tech, which I see
          as an awesome learning opportunity.
          </p>

          Before I got to Tech, I went to highschool in Robbinsville New Jersey
          (N.J born and raised). There, I worked on our FIRST Robotics
          Competition (FRC) team, FRC 2590: Nemesis. I had a really great time
          there; I made alot of new friends and really got an opportunity to
          grow as a person. My first two years on the team, I assisted in
          programming the robot, but my final year I was actually in charge
          of the software subteam. That's when I really learned the most about
          the robot hardware and electronics, and how to bring all of the
          components together with the software (the robot was programmed with
          labview by the way, which makes me feel dirty). Robotics programming
          is a whole lot of fun, but it's not really
          the specific path I'm planning to head down career wise. Robots are
          cool though. Talk to me about them. I like cool stuff. I'm down for
          most projects as long as they seem cool.

          <h1>Projects</h1>
          <p>
          Here are some of those projects that I was talking about. Some of them
          are pretty nifty. Some of them are unfinished. Feel free to check out
          any of them that pique your interest. I have a few projects on my
          GitHub that I'm not featuring here. Mostly because they were just
          little exercises for me.

          This was a tool we actually used during the Spring 2017 semester for
          CS1331 at Georgia Tech. We wanted to be able to submit student
          projects to the university Github without having to make the students
          learn Git. I made the version 1.0 of this over the weekend in case our
          professor wasn't able to finish making one (he was working on his
          thesis defense that semester and was swamped with work). At the
          eleventh hour he pinged our slack to tell us we would just do
          submission through the university site, and I was just like, 'hey I
          made this thing tho.' After some cross platform testing we
          decided to roll with it, and used it for the rest of the semester. It
          was a bit rocky with different bugs popping up all over the place
          though. One in particular was that the file separators on some South
          Korean Windows machines were different from ones that I was expecting,
          so I had to do tech support for alot of international students to
          make sure they could get their homework in. By the end of the
          semester, alot of the *ahem* client facing bugs were worked out, but
          we decided that in the future we would avoid developing tools in this
          manner where students end up being the beta testers. Overall, it
          worked pretty well, and most students never had an issue with it.
          For those that did have issues, I was listening on the class forum to
          do some bug bashing. This was almost like my first real software
          development experience. A good lesson to learn is that software
          development can have a tendency to be... messy...

          <h2>Wikipedia Summarizer</h2>

          A project I'm actually working on right now is this little one that
          can summarize wikipedia articles. It's a bit of a toy project, but
          it's fun because my python is a bit rusty, so it gives me a chance
          to brush up on that a bit before my classes next semester. Doing this
          also gives me a chance to play around with alot of the useful
          libraries that python has. This project is going to be using
          BeautifulSoup, NLTK, and maybe also sci-kit learn. It's not totally
          done yet because I've been taking my old sweet time with it (mostly
          a weekend thing, and I tend to go into comas on the weekend). I hope
          that working on this project will help expand my skill set a bit
          though. Alot of the libraries used in this project also have some
          applications for machine learning projects, which I may want to check
          out because it seems nifty.

          When I was younger, I was a bit more interested in video game
          programming, so making a simple engine seemed like a pretty cool
          idea. This actually started to feel pretty doable though during a
          lecture in my freshman Linear Algebra class. My professor gave a
          lecture on computer graphics and how linear algebra can be used to
          give 2D objects a 3D appearance. So, I decided to use OpenGL's 2D
          library to make a basic 3D environment. Right now it's pretty low
          level, and there are some bugs and leaks. I'm not currently developing
          this project further because I have some other things I'd rather
          be working on. If I decide to mess around with video games again
          in the future though, this is a pretty cool reference to have. One of
          the open issues I had with this was being able to layer shapes
          properly. At the moment, the program is two rectangles suspended in
          3D space that you can walk around. You'll notice pretty quick though
          that the rectangles don't always get drawn on top of eachother
          correctly ;)

          <h2>IRC Bots</h2>
          <a href="https://github.com/JH456/DL-IRC">
          <i class="fa fa-keyboard-o fa-6 left"></i>
          </a>
          <p>
          During my junior year of highschool, my friend got me to start talking
          with him over IRC. He made this really awesome bot for our channel,
          and helped me learn how to make one too! We coded our bots in
          JavaScript, because NodeJS has many packages that making coding a
          breeze. Developing these bots was some of the best fun I ever had
          coding! We made it so that they could dance (print out /o/ and \o\
          alot), store user data, and even send Yo's to people using the Yo API.
          I made mine so that it could send Yo's in a loop, so that I could
          launch Yo flood attacks on people (Not really too malicious, but super
          annoying). Although the API could only send one Yo per minute to
          combat this, to some degree, the staggering makes it much more
          annoying. I would tell kids in my classes to make a Yo account and
          send a Yo to my bot (he could only send Yo's to people that Yo him
          first, so kind of like an annoying vampire). Once they did, I would
          send them 800 Yo's. It was great. Ultimately I made two JS IRC bots,
          Pann-IRC and DL-IRC. The first one was my fun bot that I put random
          features into, and the latter I used to download youtube videos using
          youtube-dl. Both of these bots are on my GitHub. However, I have some
          favoritism toward DL-IRC because the code for that one is neater, and
          the config is updated to be more complex and awesome.
