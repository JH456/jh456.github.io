          <p>
          Here are some of those projects that I was talking about. Some of them
          are pretty nifty. Some of them are unfinished. Feel free to check out
          any of them that pique your interest. I have a few projects on my
          GitHub that I'm not featuring here. Mostly because they were just
          little exercises for me.

          This was a tool we actually used during the Spring 2017 semester for
          CS1331 at Georgia Tech. We wanted to be able to submit student
          projects to the university Github without having to make the students
          learn Git. I made the version 1.0 of this over the weekend in case our
          professor wasn't able to finish making one (he was working on his
          thesis defense that semester and was swamped with work). At the
          eleventh hour he pinged our slack to tell us we would just do
          submission through the university site, and I was just like, 'hey I
          made this thing tho.' After some cross platform testing we
          decided to roll with it, and used it for the rest of the semester. It
          was a bit rocky with different bugs popping up all over the place
          though. One in particular was that the file separators on some South
          Korean Windows machines were different from ones that I was expecting,
          so I had to do tech support for alot of international students to
          make sure they could get their homework in. By the end of the
          semester, alot of the *ahem* client facing bugs were worked out, but
          we decided that in the future we would avoid developing tools in this
          manner where students end up being the beta testers. Overall, it
          worked pretty well, and most students never had an issue with it.
          For those that did have issues, I was listening on the class forum to
          do some bug bashing. This was almost like my first real software
          development experience. A good lesson to learn is that software
          development can have a tendency to be... messy...

          <h2>Wikipedia Summarizer</h2>

          A project I'm actually working on right now is this little one that
          can summarize wikipedia articles. It's a bit of a toy project, but
          it's fun because my python is a bit rusty, so it gives me a chance
          to brush up on that a bit before my classes next semester. Doing this
          also gives me a chance to play around with alot of the useful
          libraries that python has. This project is going to be using
          BeautifulSoup, NLTK, and maybe also sci-kit learn. It's not totally
          done yet because I've been taking my old sweet time with it (mostly
          a weekend thing, and I tend to go into comas on the weekend). I hope
          that working on this project will help expand my skill set a bit
          though. Alot of the libraries used in this project also have some
          applications for machine learning projects, which I may want to check
          out because it seems nifty.

          <h2>3D Graphics</h2>

          When I was younger, I was a bit more interested in video game
          programming, so making a simple engine seemed like a pretty cool
          idea. This actually started to feel pretty doable though during a
          lecture in my freshman Linear Algebra class. My professor gave a
          lecture on computer graphics and how linear algebra can be used to
          give 2D objects a 3D appearance. So, I decided to use OpenGL's 2D
          library to make a basic 3D environment. Right now it's pretty low
          level, and there are some bugs and leaks. I'm not currently developing
          this project further because I have some other things I'd rather
          be working on. If I decide to mess around with video games again
          in the future though, this is a pretty cool reference to have. One of
          the open issues I had with this was being able to layer shapes
          properly. At the moment, the program is two rectangles suspended in
          3D space that you can walk around. You'll notice pretty quick though
          that the rectangles don't always get drawn on top of eachother
          correctly ;)

          <h2>IRC Bots</h2>
          <a href="https://github.com/JH456/DL-IRC">

          </a>
          <p>
          During my junior year of highschool, my friend got me to start talking
          with him over IRC. He made this really awesome bot for our channel,
          and helped me learn how to make one too! We coded our bots in
          JavaScript, because NodeJS has many packages that making coding a
          breeze. Developing these bots was some of the best fun I ever had
          coding! We made it so that they could dance (print out /o/ and \o\
          alot), store user data, and even send Yo's to people using the Yo API.
          I made mine so that it could send Yo's in a loop, so that I could
          launch Yo flood attacks on people (Not really too malicious, but super
          annoying). Although the API could only send one Yo per minute to
          combat this, to some degree, the staggering makes it much more
          annoying. I would tell kids in my classes to make a Yo account and
          send a Yo to my bot (he could only send Yo's to people that Yo him
          first, so kind of like an annoying vampire). Once they did, I would
          send them 800 Yo's. It was great. Ultimately I made two JS IRC bots,
          Pann-IRC and DL-IRC. The first one was my fun bot that I put random
          features into, and the latter I used to download youtube videos using
          youtube-dl. Both of these bots are on my GitHub. However, I have some
          favoritism toward DL-IRC because the code for that one is neater, and
          the config is updated to be more complex and awesome.
