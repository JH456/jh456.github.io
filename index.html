          <p>
          Hello! Welcome to my website! I'm a Computer Science student
          studying at the Georgia Institute of Technology with a specialization
          in internet security. Born in New Jersey, I studied at Robbinsville
          Highschool and participated on the software subteam (which I led
          during the 2015 season) for our local Robotics team, FRC 2590,
          Nemesis. Around this time, I first developed an interest in
          programming for creating video games which I had a lifelong passion
          for. After experimenting with that, I discovered an even greater
          passion for computer security. I realized that making video games
          isn't what interested me specifically; making fun projects in
          general interested me, and the recurring conflict with each
          project I took on came back to security. How can this robot be
          made safe? How do we stop people from exploiting glitches in this
          game? How can I password protect this website? So essentially, I
          think security is fun because it makes it possible to do other fun
          things. I hope to, after earning my degree, establish a career in
          cyber security so that I can help make these fun things possible.
          In pursuit of this goal, I have learned a large number of
          different programming languages including C, C++, Java,
          JavaScript, LabView, Python, PHP, and markup languages such as
          HTML and CSS. A friend and I are currently in the process of
          learning Ruby on Rails so that we can learn more about web
          frameworks and how to implement them in projects. Feel free to
          download a resume` or check me out on social media!
          </p>
          <h1>Projects</h1>
          <p>
          I try to keep myself working on personal software projects. Doing this
          helps me to build my skills, while working on something that I have a
          vested interest in. Whether I'm learning a new language or just trying
          to have some fun with friends, a project always makes coding much more
          fun! Here, I'll talk about a few projects that I'm especially proud
          of.
          </p>
          <h2>Blackjack</h2>
          <a href="https://github.com/JH456/Text-Based-Blackjack">
          <i class="fa fa-heart fa-6 left"></i>
          </a>
          <p>
          The first language I started with was java, back in my freshman year
          of highschool. However, after a few days of struggling to figure out
          how NetBeans is supposed to work, I switched to C++, which I for some
          reason found easier to pick up. I haven't had too much use for that
          language throughout highschool and college though, so I try to keep it
          fresh. One project I worked on to that end is a console based
          blackjack game! A classic beginner's program, blackjack covers many
          basic programming techniques. It also gave me an excuse to use cool
          ascii box drawing characters to make the cards! Feel free to check out
          the full source code on my github account (giant symbol on the left)!
          </p>
          <h2>3D Graphics</h2>
          <a href="https://github.com/JH456/OGL-3D-Practice-Engine">
          <i class="fa fa-cubes fa-6 right"></i>
          </a>
          <p>
          While on the topic of C++, another program I've been working on is a
          basic 3D graphics engine. I'm especially excited about this, though I
          see it as more of a longterm project. Hopefully, I can eventually turn
          this into my very own video game! My interest in this started during a
          lecture in my freshman Linear Algebra class. My professor gave a
          lecture on computer graphics and how linear algebra can be used to
          give 2D objects a 3D appearance. So, I decided to use OpenGL's 2D
          library to make a basic 3D environment! Right now it's pretty low
          level, and there are some bugs and leaks, but I plan to work them out
          in the future as I learn more about how to address them.
          </p>
          <h2>IRC Bots</h2>
          <a href="https://github.com/JH456/DL-IRC">
          <i class="fa fa-keyboard-o fa-6 left"></i>
          </a>
          <p>
          During my junior year of highschool, my friend got me to start talking
          with him over IRC. He made this really awesome bot for our channel,
          and helped me learn how to make one too! We coded our bots in
          JavaScript, because NodeJS has many packages that making coding a
          breeze. Developing these bots was some of the best fun I ever had
          coding! We made it so that they could dance (print out /o/ and \o\
          alot), store user data, and even send Yo's to people using the Yo API.
          I made mine so that it could send Yo's in a loop, so that I could
          launch Yo flood attacks on people (Not really too malicious, but super
          annoying). Although the API could only send one Yo per minute to
          combat this, to some degree, the staggering makes it much more
          annoying. I would tell kids in my classes to make a Yo account and
          send a Yo to my bot (he could only send Yo's to people that Yo him
          first, so kind of like an annoying vampire). Once they did, I would
          send them 800 Yo's. It was great. Ultimately I made two JS IRC bots,
          Pann-IRC and DL-IRC. The first one was my fun bot that I put random
          features into, and the latter I used to download youtube videos using
          youtube-dl. Both of these bots are on my GitHub. However, I have some
          favoritism toward DL-IRC because the code for that one is neater, and
          the config is updated to be more complex and awesome.
          </p>
          <h2>Website</h2>
          <a href="https://github.com/JH456/jh456.github.io">
          <i class="fa fa-globe fa-6 right"></i>
          </a>
          <p>
          I also shouldn't forget that this website is one of my longterm
          projects as well! My friend and I are doing a joint project to learn
          Ruby on Rails, and I hope to apply that knowledge to make this site
          cooler. I intend to host it on a digital ocean server that previously
          hosted a password protected internet radio stream (my friend and I
          made radio servers so that we would have something to listen to while
          playing Euro Truck Simulator 2). Hopefully I can set it up as a blog
          for the projects that I work on! As for the joint project we're
          working on, development has been relatively slow after our initial
          burst. We both were in school already when we decided to start, and
          we've both been busy, but hope to reboot development in the next few
          months. The project is to make a website that we can listen to music
          off of youtube together on, similar to how plug.dj works.
          We used to use Plug all the time, but it went under due to bad
          business decisions (They decided to shift their market toward 12 year
          old kids who want to spend money on avatars, so they spent tons of
          money on artwork and drove away their older audience by making the
          site more juvenile). Working on projects while listening to music
          together makes the experience much more fun, so we want to get that
          rolling soon. There are other options, but they are just. Not. The.
          Same.
