			<h2>About me</h2>
			<div id='aboutMe' class='section'>
				Hello! Welcome to my website! I'm a Computer Science student studying at the Georgia Institute of Technology with a specialization in internet security. Born in New Jersey, I studied at Robbinsville Highschool and participated on the software subteam (which I led during the 2015 season) for our local Robotics team, FRC 2590, Nemesis. Around this time, I first developed an interest in programming for creating video games which I had a lifelong passion for. After experimenting with that, I discovered an even greater passion for computer security. I realized that making video games isn't what interested me specifically; making fun projects in general interested me, and the recurring conflict with each project I took on came back to security. How can this robot be made safe? How do we stop people from exploiting glitches in this game? How can I password protect this website? So essentially, I think security is fun because it makes it possible to do other fun things. I hope to, after earning my degree, establish a career in cyber security so that I can help make these fun things possible. In pursuit of this goal, I have learned a large number of different programming languages including C, C++, Java, JavaScript, LabView, Python, PHP, and markup languages such as HTML and CSS. A friend and I are currently in the process of learning Ruby on Rails so that we can create more about how web frameworks and how to implement them in projects. Feel free to download a resume` or check me out on social media!

			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<div id='projects' class='section'>
				I have worked on several projects over the last couple years, ranging from robot software to small videogames. Most of them are not published, but I have a couple projects posted on my GitHub account. These include a JavaScript IRC bot that I created using several third party APIs, and a textbased C++ Blackjack game with ascii graphics.
