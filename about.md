My name is Jim Harris. I graduated from Georgia Tech's CS program in May, 2019, and will be enrolled in the BS/MS
program in Computer Science at Georgia Tech in the Fall under the Computing Systems specialization. I hope to get a
stronger background in Cybersecurity and start a career in the field.

Over the summer of 2018, I worked at AWS on the Secrets Manager team, and will be returning to AWS for another
internship this summer.

I also have worked as an undergraduate TA at Georgia Tech, and plan to TA at the major league level in the upcoming
season for the LA Dodgers.

Some of my interests/hobbies include:

* Watching movies,
* Origami,
* Lockpicking,
* Salt posting on Piazza dot com,
* Memes
